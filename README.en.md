## Why you need it

Every OpenClaw agent session starts fresh. Without memory organization, your agent will:
- ❌ **Context overflow** — long conversations push out important info, forcing a memory-wiping /reset
- ❌ **Fragmented memory** — decisions and project state scattered across daily logs, impossible to find
- ❌ **Missing MEMORY.md** — no long-term memory file, every session feels like a first meeting
- ❌ **Duplicate bloat** — the same content written over and over, memory files growing out of control

This skill solves it all in one go: **semantic classification + first-run memory building + incremental dedup + sensitive-info protection**.

## Features

- 🧪 **Semantic classification** — Core → root `MEMORY.md`; Daily → `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`; Temporary → current day only (semantic understanding, not keyword matching)
- 🏗️ **First-run memory building** — if `MEMORY.md` is missing, auto-generate it from historical logs — no empty skeleton
- 🔁 **Incremental dedup** — checks existing content before writing; appends only new entries, merges duplicates
- 🔒 **Sensitive-info skip** — tokens/passwords/keys auto-detected, never written to disk by default
- 🗄️ **Archive, never delete** — expired logs move to `archive/`, deletion requires human confirmation
- 🕐 **Three trigger modes** — one-phrase manual, daily Cron, HEARTBEAT dynamic
- 🧍 **Per-agent isolation** — each agent only organizes its own workspace memory
- 🏠 **Pairs with initializer** — it manages the "home" of your memory system; this skill manages the "content"

## Install

```bash
# From ClawHub (recommended)
clawhub install xiaoyaoclaw-memory-distill

# Or manually from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/dtsola/xiaoyaoclaw-memory-distill
# Put SKILL.md and templates/ into your skills directory
```

## Usage

1. Put the skill in your OpenClaw skills directory
2. Tell your agent "**distill memory**" (or in Chinese: 「蒸馏记忆」) — it will automatically:
   - Check `memory/` and `MEMORY.md` (if missing, **build memory from historical logs**)
   - Scan the session → classify semantically → show a distill report (with sensitive-info notices)
   - Write incrementally with dedup → report results
3. Optional: say "schedule memory distill at 22:00 daily" to enable Cron automation

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 steps, 5 minutes)

### Step 1: Install the skill

```bash
clawhub install xiaoyaoclaw-memory-distill
```

### Step 2: Trigger your first distill

Tell your agent:

> distill memory

It will: check memory state → (build MEMORY.md from history if missing) → scan the session → classify → show report → write after confirmation → report back.

### Step 3: Verify + enable automation (optional)

Open your workspace and verify:

```
workspace root/
├── MEMORY.md               ← long-term memory (core) is ready
├── distill-config.json     ← distill configuration
└── memory/
    └── YYYY-MM-DD.md       ← today's distill log
```

Want daily automation? Tell your agent:

> schedule memory distill at 22:00 daily

When context is nearly full: "distill memory" first, then `/reset` — nothing is lost.

### Daily habits

| Scenario | Action |
|---|---|
| Session ends / context nearly full | Say "distill memory", then /reset |
| Long-term use | Schedule daily Cron at 22:00 |
| Weekly consolidation | Say "consolidate memory" → merge the last 7 days into MEMORY.md |
| Sensitive conversations | Auto-skipped by the report, nothing to do |

## How it compares

| | systiger/memory-distill | **xiaoyaoclaw-memory-distill** |
|---|---|---|
| Classification | keyword matching | ✅ semantic (core/daily/temporary) |
| Missing MEMORY.md | empty skeleton only | ✅ first-run build from history logs |
| Duplicate writes | no protection, bloats | ✅ incremental dedup & merge |
| Sensitive info | a one-line note | ✅ auto-detected and skipped |
| Expired cleanup | auto-delete (retentionDays) | ✅ archive only; delete needs confirmation |
| Auto /reset | config option exists | ✅ not provided (user decides) |
| Multi-agent memory | not distinguished | ✅ each agent handles its own |
| Workspace conventions | unrelated | ✅ paths follow WORKSPACE.md, config safety inherited from initializer |
